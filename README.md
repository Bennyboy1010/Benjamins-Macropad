What is this?
This is a macro pad that has 16 customizable switches. the keys are layed out in a 4 by 4 layuout.
ill be mainly using it for games such as msfs 2024, warthunder and ksp. it will also be used for controlling music.
like play, pause, skip and replay. It wont be able to controll the volume though.

Ive also included a little window on the lid to let me see the writing i put on the pcb. i may remove this hole later if it looks odd or i cant see the sentance that well

It was certainly an experience on how to make this. I had to learn Kicad which was a new software to me. It took a while learning all the footprints and etc, but eventually i got there in the end.
